Say hello to the ICS Study Hub. This was a project that my group and I had worked on for almost a month during our time in ICS 314, the idea essentially being a small online corner for ICS students to meet at to get help, search for sessions with similar goals, etc. I was responsible for taking care of the user profile while also providing some additional testcafe tests (ensuring that the program ran under a set of parameters.

While it was a little bit incomplete, I did fulfill one major goal; help provide an online service that would serve as a type of blueprint or inspiration for those who wanted to create a website to help students study in an online-only environment. The concept itself is an excellent idea; kind of like Facebook but for academic purposes.
