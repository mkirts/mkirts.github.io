Upon entering this class, I always thought of programming as this special thing that is meant for people such as myself to learn how to create things, make things simpler for other people. That's still the case, but like learning a language, it's not easy. Javascript is very similar to that of the programming language that I'm used to using, Java. It's fun, it's straightforward, yet it has better functionality.

Obviously, I have never worked with Javascript, so naturally the syntax would be a little bit foreign to me. Thankfully, it wasn't so foreign that I had to purchase a "Javascript for Dummies" book. Having prior knowledge of Java and even C++ helped me get used to working with Javascript.

Like with every language, foreign or programming, practice... well, it doesn't make perfect but it gets you very close to perfect with enough time. That is where the WODs come in; every week, we do one practice WOD and then an actual WOD. Both of these are meant to be practice for programming, and both help you get a better idea on how you will be hired for programming-related jobs. It's not just being asked "What is your skillset?"; it is "Can you show me what you can do?"

The meat of this class comes from the time you invest into practicing, and really that's how it is for every language class. It is a fun experience; you make mistakes and you learn from them, you better understand a programming language or programming software. Most importantly, with this class, you have been given what's essentially building blocks to newer ventures, and the key to the door of software engineering oppurtunities.
