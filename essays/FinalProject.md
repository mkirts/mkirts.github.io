## Overview
I feel that the pandemic has really taken it's toll on everyone, causing a large amount of stress, anxiety, depression, and internal problems for the students along with their friends and their family. With what seems to be no end to the pandemic in the immediate future, we have to turn to online resources. My idea is that I want to create some sort of a message board that will give an opportunity to students, faculty, and non-campus residents alike in the form of a message board. This is no original idea by any means, but I feel that it will help with people in many ways:
- It can help provide some closure to mental problems.
- People can discuss hardships that they are facing.
- Include a private message board filled with encouraging messages to everyone.

## Approach
As mentioned above, the idea is to get people who are dealing with problems to talk about their problems. I am certain that this will contain a large amount of information and a good amount of research, not just coding wise but also guidance-wise. However, I believe that with a site like this, peoples spirits can be raised and we can help provide a massive boost in hope, especially since it is in very low supply after the past events. There are several pages that I do have in mind that could help achieve this goal, like a landing page that provides some general information, an inspirational quotes message page that contains a massive (and increasing) compilation of inspirational quotes from popular figures and celebrities, and most importantly a message wall or two that contains messages from people affected by the pandemic who wants to open up and release a massive level of stress. Additionally, I want to see if I can try and make a private message tab that allows for people to communicate with one of several admins, providing the opportunity to speak with someone personally.

## Some Cases
- The user can simply enter the page and, from the landing, can go to the Inspiration, Extra Help, or Message Board tabs
- The user can log in to get into contact with one or several people via the Message Board and communicate through there.
- The user can visit the Private Message tab to talk with one of the admins, or one of the other users personally.

## More Advanced Ideas
While I am not sure if we could implement this, I would hope that I can accomplish one of the following when the time permits:
- Immediate access to professional therapists who can possibly help in improving ones mental state.
- Group private message chat, allowing for multiple people to talk and even chill and participate in activities.
- If one is suffering with severe depression, provide a questionnaire. When fully filled, the system will attempt to provide a sufficient answer on what the user should do (and not just tell them to try and relax since that might be easier said than done for many people).
