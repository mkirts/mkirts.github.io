Professional gaming isn’t exactly an easy route to take. Contrary to what many believe, it’s a little more than just playing the game for what it is and having fun; it requires constant practice, various tactical approaches, and above all patience. Which is why I wanted to talk about how to better prepare for professional gaming. It will not be an easy path, but if you do plan to play games professionally, you should at least read what I have to say about that.

In gaming, you play to have fun. You need to remember that; do not let the professional gaming scene get to you entirely. Give it your ninety percent, but not your all. Doing this helps relieve the stress that you may face as a pro gamer. After all, whether you are there to build up a career, trying something new, or just simply having fun, you are still human. When I played games like Overwatch or Halo: Reach, I found it more relaxing to have breather rounds, or rather rounds where you are not playing competitively.

Additionally, you want to play with people that you can get comfortable with. It is much easier to play with people that you know as opposed with total strangers. While in competitive modes it will be inevitable that you will face against some nasty or unsportsmanlike players, playing with your friends or colleagues will help ease things.

Finally, you should always attempt different strategies. No one strategy will work every time; charging head-first into the firefight or holding back for more than half the game will not get you a victory. You have to take a different approach more often than not; sometimes splitting into smaller divisions will help, other times moving into the objective as a team will help assert dominance.

While these are very basic, they are more than enough to help you for any kind of professional gaming. Also, if you are a student and are planning to do professional gaming; always prioritize your studies over your games. You want to stay mentally active and sometimes, getting your mind off of the past few losses will help you cool down.
